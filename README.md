# Description 

This project involves analysing the dataset containing calls made to 311 for non-emergency services in the year 2020.\
\
The Top10 notebook analyzes the top 10 causes of calls made to 311 in the zip code 10027, and outputs a pandas series reporting a list of the cause, with the   number of calls made relating to that particular cause.\
\
The Parking notebook analyzes whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of the total 311 incidents in 10027 zipcode than theuy are in general.
